# SEA
Implementation of the Slice Elasticity Architecture

This project is still under development, but the main components can be visualized or even tested.
Also, we added all the yaml files used in our Scenarios. 

The idea in a near future is to provide a vm with the main components running and ready to be used and tested
for everyone.
