# SEA
Implementation of the Slice Elasticity Architecture

This project is still under development, but the main components can be visualized or even tested.
Also, we added all the yaml files used in our Scenarios. 

The idea in a near future is to provide a vm with the main components running and ready to be used and tested
for everyone.

Questions can be addressed to debeltrami@gmail.com.

The following steps should be done in order to start the SEA components:
* Create the docker images containing the code of the adapters that will be used in your tests.
* Map your slice infrastructure to the yaml files needed to start the SEA components to monitoringand orchestrating the slice.
** You must have the slice infrastructure already deployed, including the VIMs/WIMs and MEs defined in your SPs. 

Note: Further we intend to give a full example of yaml files and how to execute them to have the slice elasticity being performed.
